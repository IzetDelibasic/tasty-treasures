# Tasty Treasures - React.js Recipe Application

This repository contains my first frontend web application built with React.js, featuring user registration, login functionality, recipe listing, recipe search by keyword, and support for light and dark modes.

## Project Description

This application was created to showcase my skills in web development using React.js and Firebase. The app allows users to register and log in, storing their profiles in a Firebase database. Users can browse recipes, search for recipes by keyword, and get random recipes.

The application also offers users the option to switch between light and dark modes for a better user experience.

## Additional Features

This application currently supports user registration, login, recipe browsing, recipe search by keyword, and displaying random recipes. I plan to add additional features such as adding custom recipes, rating recipes, commenting, and much more.

If you have ideas for additional features or want to contribute to the project, feel free to open an "issue" or send a "pull request." Your contribution is welcome!

Thank you for using this application, and good luck with further development!
